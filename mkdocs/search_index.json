It is in relation to the center \n1.0\n.  So a value of \n0.01\n would shift it \n1.01\n. It also takes a direction argument which is denoted with a \n+\n or \n-\n direction. You can limit the filter to the background or foreground using the \ncontext\n argument and giving it a value of \nbg\n or \nfg\n respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturation\n\n\nThemeTweakerSaturationCommand\n can take a step value of float type to determine the magnitude of saturation to apply.

You can post pictures, but if specific text or code is required to reproduce the issue, please provide the text in a plain text format for easy copy/paste.\n\n\n\n\nThe more info provided the greater the chance someone will take the time to answer, implement, or fix the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe prepared to answer questions and provide additional information if required.  Issues in which the creator refuses to respond to follow up questions will be marked as stale and closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewing Code\n\n\nTake part in reviewing pull requests and/or reviewing direct commits.  Make suggestions to improve the code and discuss solutions to overcome weakness in the algorithm.\n\n\nPull Requests\n\n\nPull requests are welcome, and if you plan on contributing directly to the code, there are a couple of things to be mindful of.\n\n\nContinuous integration tests on are run on all pull requests and commits via Travis CI.  When making a pull request, the tests will automatically be run, and the request must pass to be accepted.  You can (and should) run these tests before pull requesting.  If it is not possible to run these tests locally, they will be run when the pull request is made, but it is strongly suggested that requesters make an effort to verify before requesting to allow for a quick, smooth merge.\n\n\nFeel free to use a virtual environment if you are concerned about installing any of the Python packages.  In the future, I may use tox, but as I currently only test on Python 3.3, I wanted to keep things simple.\n\n\nRunning Validation Tests\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you are running Sublime on a OSX or Linux/Unix system, you run all tests by by running the shell script (assuming you have installed your environment fulfills all requirements below):\n\n\nchmod +x run_tests.sh\n./run_tests.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of dependencies that must be present before running the tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs \nST3\n is the only current actively supported version, Python 3.3 must be used to validate the tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit tests are run with \nnose\n.  You can install nose via:\n\n\npip install nose\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tests should be run from the root folder of the plugin by using the following command:\n\n\nnosetests .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed on the entire project with \nflake8\n, \nflake8_docstrings\n, and \npep8-naming\n.  These can be installed via:\n\n\npip install flake8\npip install flake8_docstrings\npip install pep8-naming\n\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed with the following command:\n\n\nflake8 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation Improvements\n\n\nA ton of time has been not only creating and supporting this plugin, but also spent making this documentation.  If you feel it is still lacking, show your appreciation for the plugin by helping to improve the documentation.  Help with documentation is always appreciated and can be done via pull requests.  There shouldn\nt be any need to run validation tests if only updating documentation.\n\n\nI currently use a combination of using [mkdocs][mkdocs.org] with my own custom Python Markdown \nextensions\n to render the docs.  You can preview the docs if you install these two packages.  The command for previewing the docs is \nmkdocs serve\n.",

Examples for reproducing the error.  You can post pictures, but if specific text or code is required to reproduce the issue, please provide the text in a plain text format for easy copy/paste.

Continuous integration tests on are run on all pull requests and commits via Travis CI.  When making a pull request, the tests will automatically be run, and the request must pass to be accepted.  You can (and should) run these tests before pull requesting.  If it is not possible to run these tests locally, they will be run when the pull request is made, but it is strongly suggested that requesters make an effort to verify before requesting to allow for a quick, smooth merge.  Feel free to use a virtual environment if you are concerned about installing any of the Python packages.  In the future, I may use tox, but as I currently only test on Python 3.3, I wanted to keep things simple.  Running Validation Tests   Tip  If you are running Sublime on a OSX or Linux/Unix system, you run all tests by by running the shell script (assuming you have installed your environment fulfills all requirements below):  chmod +x run_tests.sh\n./run_tests.sh   There are a couple of dependencies that must be present before running the tests.    As  ST3  is the only current actively supported version, Python 3.3 must be used to validate the tests.    Unit tests are run with  nose .  You can install nose via:  pip install nose  The tests should be run from the root folder of the plugin by using the following command:  nosetests .    Linting is performed on the entire project with  flake8 ,  flake8_docstrings , and  pep8-naming .  These can be installed via:  pip install flake8\npip install flake8_docstrings\npip install pep8-naming  Linting is performed with the following command:  flake8 .",

If you feel it is still lacking, show your appreciation for the plugin by helping to improve the documentation.  Help with documentation is always appreciated and can be done via pull requests.  There shouldn t be any need to run validation tests if only updating documentation.  I currently use a combination of using [mkdocs][mkdocs.org] with my own custom Python Markdown  extensions  to render the docs.  You can preview the docs if you install these two packages.  The command for previewing the docs is  mkdocs serve .",
