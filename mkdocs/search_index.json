You can install nose via:\n\n\npip install nose\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tests should be run from the root folder of the plugin by using the following command:\n\n\nnosetests .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed on the entire project with \nflake8\n, \nflake8_docstrings\n, and \npep8-naming\n.  These can be installed via:\n\n\npip install flake8\npip install flake8_docstrings\npip install pep8-naming\n\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed with the following command:\n\n\nflake8 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation Improvements\n\n\nA ton of time has been spent not only creating and supporting this plugin, but also spent making this documentation.  If you feel it is still lacking, show your appreciation for the plugin by helping to improve the documentation.  Help with documentation is always appreciated and can be done via pull requests.  There shouldn\nt be any need to run validation tests if only updating documentation.\n\n\nYou don\nt have to render the docs locally before pull requesting, but if you wish to, I currently use a combination of \nmkdocs\n with my own custom Python Markdown \nextensions\n to render the docs.  You can preview the docs if you install these two packages.  The command for previewing the docs is \nmkdocs serve\n from the root directory.",
